# Star-Trek-Game
A fun Star Trek themed game I made in 2019. 

### Goal of the game
The goal is to move the starship Enterprise to avoid hitting the Borg cubes. If you see a Borg sphere, you can fire at it to gain points.

### Future development
- One-time-use button to destroy all ships on screen
- Explosion sound
